### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) Sign Off

:warning: Important: All contributions __must__ follow our [Developer Certificate of Origin
(DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) sign off process, which means that you must include a
`DCO Sign Off` in every commit message. You can do this by adding the `--signoff` flag to your
`git commit` command:

```bash
# Sign off a commit as you're making it
git commit --signoff -m "Update README.md"

# Add a signoff to the last commit you made
git commit --amend --signoff

# Rebase your branch against master and sign off every commit in your branch
git rebase --signoff master
```

Please note that PRs without `DCO Sign Off` will not be accepted.
